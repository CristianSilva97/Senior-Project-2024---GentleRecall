# Gentle-Recall by Cristian Camilo Silva Padilla
# Introduction:
This proof-of-concept game presents a gentle, interactive approach to supporting individuals experiencing memory challenges, such as those seen in Alzheimer’s. By incorporating familiar images, personalized puzzles, and step-by-step memory tasks, the game aims to transform routine cognitive exercises into engaging, meaningful experiences. Through this integration of play and purpose, the project demonstrates how gamification can encourage participants to actively engage with their memories, helping maintain cognitive stimulation and emotional connection.

# Objectives and Goals:

Cognitive Engagement: Enhance recall through image-based memory puzzles that gradually reveal cherished photographs.

Personalization: Allow caregivers or loved ones to upload meaningful images, creating a more emotionally resonant and supportive environment.

Accessibility and Simplicity: Present tasks that are easy to understand, minimizing frustration and encouraging repeated engagement.

Proof of Concept: Offer a foundation for future development, inviting others to expand on these initial ideas and refine the approach.

Gamification of Alzheimer’s Cognitive Exercises:
By turning memory exercises into a game, this project taps into core elements of engagement—fun, challenge, and a sense of achievement. The puzzles reward correct matches with incremental image reveals, turning each moment of success into positive reinforcement. This structured approach can help motivate users who might otherwise find traditional exercises repetitive or discouraging. Gamification thus becomes a supportive tool, gently nudging the player to persevere, stimulating memory recall in a way that feels less clinical and more uplifting.

# Current State:

A functional initial puzzle that reveals an image as the player successfully matches pairs of cards.
A second puzzle that asks players to identify a person from an uploaded image and provides a heartfelt message upon success.
A final scene delivering a concluding message, open-source encouragement, and navigation to additional resources.

# Conclusion:
This project stands as a stepping stone toward more comprehensive solutions for memory support. Its open-source nature invites the community—researchers, developers, caregivers, and families—to collaborate, refine, and enhance the experience. By blending gamification principles with personalized content, we open the door to richer, more empathetic digital tools that can offer comfort, hope, and cognitive support for those on their memory journey.
